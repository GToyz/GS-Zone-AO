Title: VB6 Native HTTP/FTP Async Multiple Download
Description: Downloads any URL to a byte array/string in async mode without using any API's or external components. VB6 NATIVE CODE.
I only needed MS Common Controls to add the listview for demonstration, but the control itself doesn't require it at all. 
You can add more than one URL at the same time for download. - Accepts both HTTP and FTP url's.
